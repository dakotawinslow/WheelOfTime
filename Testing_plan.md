### Testing plan for Wheel of Time

1.  Get motor spinning at set speed with pico
2.  Measure audible interference with driver shielded (descision point)
3.  Build motor driver perfboard, assemble sheilded components
4.  Wire up faceplate
5.  Develop GUI
6.  Develop MIDI 
7.  Design amp circuit - volume control via knob or midi
8.  Determine feasability of frequency feedback
9.  Consider v0.3 (VCO/voltage inputs?)
